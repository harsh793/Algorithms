Just copy the searching file to your working directory and then import it in the file you are working on.
Import using(for Python):

    from sorting import *

The file is under work but currently has three searching algorithms.
1) Linear Search: The most basic searching algorithm with a time complexity of O(n).
                  This function returns the index of the number to be found and should be used as follows:
                  
                  t = linear_search(array, key)
                  
                  #where array is the list and key is the item to be found.
                 
2) Binary Search: Based on Divide and Conquer algorithm.
                  This function returns the index of the number to be found and should be used as follows:
                  
                  t = binary_search(array, key)
                  
                  #where array is the list and key is the item to be found.
